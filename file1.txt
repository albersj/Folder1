I. BGP MISC
A. BGP is NOT a routing protocol (per-se) 
1. think of it as an application (reachability app) 
2. used to exchange NLRI and NH info
3. relies on IGP for transport and recursion (some exceptions)
4. doesn't have own transport 
a. can't activate on int and discover nei
b. must specify peer and use TCP transport 
5. generally, BGP cannot route traffic alone (need IGP, static routes, etc)

B. PROs vs  CONs
1. PROs
a. traffic engineering
b. most scalable/extensible
2. CONs
a. slow convergence
b. can suggest, but can't dictate ingress policy

C. RID
1. RID determined via..
a. bgp router-id cmd
b. highest-IP on an UP loopback 
c. highest-IP on an UP phy interface 

D. R4#sh ip bgp 155.1.5.0
BGP routing table entry for 155.1.5.0/24, version 3
Paths: (1 available, best #1, table default)	
Flag: 0x20
  Advertised to update-groups: (Pending Update Generation)
       
  Refresh Epoch 1
 
    150.1.5.5 (metric 130816) from 150.1.5.5 (150.1.5.5)
      Origin IGP, metric 0, localpref 100, valid, external, best
      rx pathid: 0, tx pathid: 0x0

E. BGP Backdoor
1. two AS may have ‘backdoor’ via IGP  eg DSL, P-P, due to company split or merger, etc
2. BGP peers will prefer eBGP (AD 20) over backdoor IGP (eg AD 90)
3. router bgp > network XXXX mask XXXX backdoor 		! changes AD for specified route from 20 to 200
a. applies to non-local prefixes (learned routes)
b. must be on every device in AS that you want to affect (except device hosting backdoor)

F. BGP and tags
1. when redist OSPF/EIGRP --> BGP:  BGP does not retain IGP tags (there is no place in UPDATE to store that info)
2. when redist BGP --> OSPF/EIGRP
a. OSPF/EIGRP routes are tagged with previous AS (not local AS) -- IDs where the route came from
b. eg AS65004 learns route from AS65003 
c. AS65004 redist B2O
d. OSPF will have tag 65003 
e. EIGRP will have ‘administrator tag’ = 65003, it will also have local AS number = 65004

G. BGP Peering ACL
1. each side initiates connection to peer tcp/179 (uses ephemeral SPort)
2. if want ACL with one ACE for BGP
3. ensure one side passive   ie never initiates connection, only listens on tcp/179
R1#
router bgp X 
     nei 1.1.1.2 transport connection-mode passive	! R1 will never initiate connection to 1.1.1.2 tcp/179, will only listen on tcp/179
ip access-list ext ACL-WANIN
 	 permit tcp host 1.1.1.2 host 1.1.1.1 eq 179		! so now, can write specific ACE
	
H. IGP vs BGP
1. Overview
a. IGP 
1) has visibility of topology
2) attributes belong to links (ie set cost per link, not per prefix)
b. BGP
1) BGP advertises application data (destinations)
2) relies on IGP to get to those destinations
3) prefixes have attributes (ie path attributes, eg Loc-Pref, ASPATH, MED)
